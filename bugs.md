## Bug #1 - Flinch never triggers for enemy Pokemon
**Status:** Fixed
**Priority:** Critical
**File:** js/battle.js

**Description:** When the player attacks first and causes a flinch, the enemy should skip its turn. Instead, the enemy always attacked normally — flinch had no effect.

**Root cause:** The `_flinched` flag was cleared on line 853 (`this.state.enemyPokemon._flinched = false`) just before being checked on line 856 (`if (this.state.enemyPokemon._flinched)`). The condition was always false.

**Fix:** Save the flinch value into a local variable before clearing it, then use that variable in the check.
```js
// Before (broken):
this.state.enemyPokemon._flinched = false;
if (this.state.enemyPokemon._flinched) { ... }  // always false

// After (fixed):
const enemyFlinched = this.state.enemyPokemon._flinched;
this.state.enemyPokemon._flinched = false;
if (enemyFlinched) { ... }
```

## Bug #2 - Pokemon detail view shows no moves
**Status:** Fixed
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/ui.js

**Description:** Opening a Pokemon's detail screen in the party menu showed no moves.

**Root cause:** In `_showPokemonDetail`, `pokemon.moves.forEach(moveId => { const move = MOVES_DB[moveId]; ... })` treated each move as a plain string key. But moves are stored as `{id, ppUsed}` objects, so `MOVES_DB[moveId]` returned `undefined` for every move, causing them all to be skipped.

**Fix:** Use `moveObj.id` to look up the move data, and also display current PP correctly.
```js
// Before: pokemon.moves.forEach(moveId => { const move = MOVES_DB[moveId]; ... })
// After:  pokemon.moves.forEach(moveObj => { const move = MOVES_DB[moveObj.id]; ... })
```

## Bug #3 - Trainer battles from dialogue never start
**Status:** Fixed
**Priority:** High
**Files:** js/ui.js, js/engine.js

**Description:** Dialogues that trigger trainer battles (gym leaders, Team Eclipse grunts, rival, etc.) would end the dialogue but never start a battle. The game returned silently to the overworld.

**Root cause:** In `ui.js:_handleDialogueAction`, the `trainer_battle` case called `game.startTrainerBattle()` which does not exist on the `game` object. The correct method is `game.startBattle('trainer', { npc })`. Additionally, the NPC object (needed to build the trainer's team) was never passed to the UI system.

**Fix:**
1. In `engine.js:interactWithNPC`, store the NPC reference on UI before showing dialogue: `UI._currentNpc = npc;`
2. In `ui.js:_handleDialogueAction`, use `game.startBattle('trainer', { npc: this._currentNpc })` instead of the non-existent `game.startTrainerBattle()`.

## Bug #4 - Speed tie always favors the player
**Status:** Fixed
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/battle.js

**Description:** When the player's Pokemon and the enemy had the same Speed stat, the player always moved first. It should be a 50/50 coin flip.

**Root cause:** The ternary `playerSpd >= enemySpd ? true : (playerSpd === enemySpd ? Math.random() < 0.5 : false)` — the `playerSpd === enemySpd` branch in the second part can never be reached because the first condition (`>=`) already handles the equal case and returns `true`.

**Fix:** Change `>=` to `>` so equal speeds fall through to the coin-flip branch.
```js
// Before: playerSpd >= enemySpd ? true : (playerSpd === enemySpd ? Math.random() < 0.5 : false)
// After:  playerSpd >  enemySpd ? true : (playerSpd === enemySpd ? Math.random() < 0.5 : false)
```

## Bug #5 - Battle actions menu shown instead of hidden after battle ends
**Status:** Fixed
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/battle.js

**Description:** After any battle ended (win, lose, catch, run), the battle action buttons remained visible on screen when returning to the overworld, overlapping the world view.

**Root cause:** In `BattleSystem.endBattle()`, the line cleaning up the UI read `actions.classList.remove('hidden')` — removing the `hidden` class — which is the opposite of the intended behavior. The actions should be hidden when the battle ends.

**Fix:** Changed `actions.classList.remove('hidden')` to `actions.classList.add('hidden')` in `endBattle()`.

---

## Bug #6 - Losing a battle never triggers healing / blackout message
**Status:** Fixed
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/main.js

**Description:** When all the player's Pokémon fainted, `BattleSystem` called `game.endBattle('lose')`, but `game.endBattle` checked `result === 'blackout'`. The condition never matched, so the party was never healed and the "Vous avez perdu connaissance..." notification was never shown.

**Root cause:** String mismatch — `BattleSystem` passes `'lose'` but `game.endBattle` expected `'blackout'`.

**Fix:** Changed `if (result === 'blackout')` to `if (result === 'lose')` in `game.endBattle()`.

---

## Bug #7 - Rival battle on Route 7 never starts
**Status:** Fixed
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/story-data.js

**Description:** The `story_rival_route7` dialogue ended without starting a battle. The rival would say his lines and then nothing happened.

**Root cause:** The dialogue action was `{ action: 'rival_battle_r7' }`, an undefined action key. `UI._handleDialogueAction` only handles the `'trainer_battle'` action for trainer battles; `'rival_battle_r7'` fell through to the `default` case which simply advanced the dialogue index, skipping the battle entirely.

**Fix:** Changed `{ action: 'rival_battle_r7' }` to `{ action: 'trainer_battle' }` in `story-data.js`.

## Bug #8 - Professor in lab always triggers starter selection even after starter chosen
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Critical
**File:** js/world-data.js, js/engine.js

**Description:** After obtaining a starter and completing the post-starter dialogue, interacting with Prof. Oliva again in the lab always re-shows the `story_lab_starters` dialogue including the starter selection screen.

**Fix:** Prof. Oliva NPC in `world-data.js` now has `altDialogue: 'story_prof_postgame'` and `altFlag: 'has_starter'`. `interactWithNPC` in `engine.js` checks `npc.altFlag` and uses `npc.altDialogue` when the flag is true. Verified: re-interacting with Prof. after getting starter shows "Tu as déjà ton Pokémon !" dialogue instead of starter selection.

---

## Bug #9 - Dialogue box bleeds through menu and battle screens
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/ui.js

**Description:** When a dialogue is pending/active and the player opens the menu or a battle starts, the dialogue box text remains visible at the bottom of the screen, overlapping the menu and battle UI.

**Fix:** `openMenu()` now explicitly hides the dialogue box and resets `dialogue.active = false` before rendering the menu (ui.js lines 386–388). `startBattle()` in main.js also hides the dialogue box on entry. Additionally, the `_bindKeys` Escape handler checks `!this.dialogue.active` before calling `openMenu()`, preventing the menu from opening during an active dialogue entirely.

---

## Bug #10 - Move names and PP merged in battle move list
**Status:** Visually Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/ui.js (battle move rendering), js/pokemon-data.js

**Description:** In the battle ATTAQUE menu, move names and the "PP" label are concatenated without separator: "ChargePP 35/35", "RugissementPP 40/40", "Pistolet à OPP 25/25".

**Additionally:** The move "Pistolet à Eau" (Water Gun) is stored with the wrong name `'Pistolet à O'` in `pokemon-data.js:40` — "Eau" is truncated to "O".

**Fix:** `.move-btn` now uses `display: flex; flex-direction: column` so the name and PP info render on separate lines. `watergun` move name corrected to `'Pistolet à Eau'` (see Bug #20).

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Enter a battle with Aquali
2. Click ATTAQUE
3. Observe all three move buttons

**Expected:** "Charge | PP 35/35", "Rugissement | PP 40/40", "Pistolet à Eau | PP 25/25"
**Actual:** "ChargePP 35/35", "RugissementPP 40/40", "Pistolet à OPP 25/25"

## Bug #11 - Save notification not visible through menu overlay
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/ui.js (save tab), css/style.css

**Description:** Clicking "Sauvegarder maintenant" shows `showNotification('Partie sauvegardee !')` and changes the button text to "Sauvegarde OK !" briefly. However the notification toast is hidden behind the menu overlay and is never seen. The button text change does work but uses the "sauvegardee" typo (missing accent).

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Open menu → Sauvegarder tab → click "Sauvegarder maintenant"

**Expected:** A visible notification "Partie sauvegardée !" appears above the menu.
**Actual (original):** Notification renders behind the menu overlay.

**Fix:** Notification (`.notification`) has `z-index: 80`, which is higher than `#menu-overlay`'s `z-index: 60`. Both are children of `#ui-layer`. Notification renders correctly above the menu overlay. The accent typo was also fixed: `showNotification('Partie sauvegardée !')` at js/ui.js:987. Verified with persistent DOM test on 2026-03-28 — notification is fully visible above the menu panel.

## Bug #12 - Enemy Pokémon sprite off-screen in battle on sub-960px viewports
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/battle.js, css/style.css

**Description:** The game canvas is fixed at 960×640px with no responsive scaling. The enemy Pokémon sprite is drawn at 70% of canvas width (x ≈ 624–720px). On any screen narrower than ~720px, the enemy sprite is entirely invisible.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Open the game in a browser window narrower than 960px
2. Start any battle

**Expected:** Both the player's and enemy's Pokémon are visible.
**Actual:** Only the player's Pokémon (at x ≈ 184px) is visible. The enemy sprite is off-screen to the right. The HTML HP cards (positioned with CSS) remain visible, but the canvas sprites do not.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #13 - Battle party screen crashes with null party slots
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/battle.js

**Description:** Opening the party screen during battle crashed if any party slot was null. The game supports null party entries, but `_showParty` accessed `pkmn.currentHp` etc. without a null check.

**Root cause:** `game.state.party.forEach((pkmn, index) => { ... })` accessed properties on `pkmn` without checking if it was null first.

**Fix:** Added `if (!pkmn) return;` guard at the top of the forEach callback in `_showParty`.

---

## Bug #14 - Back button shown during forced switch after Pokemon faints
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/battle.js

**Description:** When the player's active Pokemon fainted, the party screen showed a "Back" button. Clicking it returned to the action menu without any active Pokemon, causing an inconsistent game state.

**Root cause:** `_showParty` always added the back button unconditionally, even during `forced_switch` phase.

**Fix:** Back button is now only added when `this.state.turnPhase !== 'forced_switch'`.

---

## Bug #15 - endBattle crashes with null party slots
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/battle.js

**Description:** `BattleSystem.endBattle()` iterated over the party to clean up battle flags and to heal on loss, but did not guard against null party entries.

**Root cause:** Both `forEach` loops accessed properties on `p` without null checks.

**Fix:** Added `if (!p) return;` guards in both forEach loops in `endBattle`.

---

## Bug #16 - pokemon-data.js functions crash on invalid Pokemon ID
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/pokemon-data.js

**Description:** Six functions — `recalcStats`, `checkEvolution`, `addExp`, `evolvePokemon`, `getExpPercent`, `calcExpGain` — all call `getPokemonById(id)` and immediately access properties on the result without checking for null. If an invalid or unknown Pokemon ID is passed, they all crash.

**Root cause:** Missing null guards after `getPokemonById` calls throughout the module.

**Fix:** Added `if (!data) return ...;` (with appropriate return value) at the top of each function after the `getPokemonById` call.

---

## Bug #17 - _deserializePokemon crashes on unknown Pokemon ID in save
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/save-system.js

**Description:** Loading a save file that contains a Pokemon whose ID no longer exists in POKEMON_DB caused a crash: `getPokemonById(data.id).name` throws because the result is null.

**Root cause:** No null check after `getPokemonById(data.id)` in `_deserializePokemon`.

**Fix:** Added a null check — if `getPokemonById` returns null, `_deserializePokemon` returns null instead of crashing. The load/party code already handles null party entries gracefully.

---

## Bug #18 - Game loop freezes permanently when tab loses visibility
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/main.js

**Description:** The game loop runs via `requestAnimationFrame`, which browsers pause when the tab is hidden (`document.visibilityState === 'hidden'`). The game has no `visibilitychange` event handler to restart the loop when the tab regains focus. Once the tab loses focus and `rAF` pauses, the game freezes: `playTime` stops incrementing, movement stops, and the game becomes unresponsive even after the tab is brought back into view.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Start a new game
2. Switch to another tab or minimize the browser for a few seconds
3. Return to the game tab
4. Observe that the game loop has stopped (player cannot move, timer frozen)

**Expected:** Game resumes normally when the tab regains visibility.
**Actual:** Game loop is permanently frozen; only a page reload recovers it.

**Root cause:** No `document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', ...)` handler in `main.js` to re-schedule `requestAnimationFrame` when `document.visibilityState` becomes `'visible'`.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #19 - Missing accents on "Pokemon", "Pokedex", "Equipe" in UI
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Cosmetic
**File:** js/ui.js

**Description:** Multiple strings in the UI are missing French accents: "Pokemon" (should be "Pokémon"), "Pokedex" (should be "Pokédex"), and "Equipe" (should be "Équipe"). This affects the starter selection title, menu tabs, section headers, and the Dresseur card stats.

**Affected locations (js/ui.js):**
- Line 298: `'Choisissez votre Pokemon !'` → `'Choisissez votre Pokémon !'`
- Line 412: `label: 'Equipe'` → `label: 'Équipe'`
- Line 414: `label: 'Pokedex'` → `label: 'Pokédex'`
- Line 473: `'Aucun Pokemon dans l\'equipe.'` → `'Aucun Pokémon dans l\'équipe.'` (two issues on same line)
- Line 827: `title.textContent = 'Pokedex'` → `'Pokédex'`
- Lines 912–913: `'Pokedex (vus)'`, `'Pokedex (captures)'` → `'Pokédex (vus)'`, `'Pokédex (captures)'`

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #20 - Wrong move name: "Pistolet à O" instead of "Pistolet à Eau"
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/pokemon-data.js

**Description:** The Water Gun move (`watergun`) has its name stored as `'Pistolet à O'` instead of the correct `'Pistolet à Eau'`. The word "Eau" (water in French) is truncated to just "O". This appears everywhere the move name is shown: the party Pokémon detail view, the battle move list, and battle messages.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Obtain Aquali as starter
2. Open menu → Équipe → click Aquali → view Attaques section
3. Observe third move: "Pistolet à O | WATER | Puiss. 40 | PP 25/25"

**Expected:** `'Pistolet à Eau'`
**Actual:** `'Pistolet à O'`

**Root cause:** Data error at `js/pokemon-data.js:40`:
```js
watergun: { name: 'Pistolet à O', ... }  // should be 'Pistolet à Eau'
```

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #21 - `_handlePlayerFaint` crashes with null party entries
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/battle.js

**Description:** `BattleSystem._handlePlayerFaint()` calls `game.state.party.filter(p => p.currentHp > 0)` without guarding against null party entries. If the party contains a null slot (which can happen after loading a save with an unknown Pokémon ID — see Bug #17), accessing `p.currentHp` on null throws a TypeError, crashing the game mid-battle.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Load a save where at least one party slot is null
2. Enter a wild battle
3. Let the active Pokémon's HP drop to 0

**Expected:** The game shows the forced-switch screen or blackout message.
**Actual:** `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'currentHp')`

**Root cause:** Line `game.state.party.filter(p => p.currentHp > 0)` in `_handlePlayerFaint` (js/battle.js:1032) — missing null guard (should be `p && p.currentHp > 0`).

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #22 - PC tile healing does not restore move PP
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/engine.js (`_healParty`)

**Description:** When the player interacts with a PC tile directly (without a nurse NPC in front of it, as in the Borgo Pokémon Center), `GameEngine._healParty()` is called. This method restores all Pokémon HP to full but does NOT restore PP. The PP restoration code in `_healParty` is broken: it checks `if (move.maxPp !== undefined)` (a field that never exists in the move data model) and sets `move.pp` instead of resetting `move.ppUsed = 0`.

Contrast with nurse NPC healing via `UI._healAllPokemon()`, which correctly restores PP with `m.ppUsed = 0`. This creates an inconsistency between the two healing paths.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Start a new game in Borgo village
2. Use some moves in battle to deplete PP
3. Walk to the PC tile in Borgo (at tile position x=8, y=17) and press Space
4. Open the menu → Équipe → check move PP

**Expected:** All Pokémon HP and PP fully restored.
**Actual:** HP restored, but ppUsed values unchanged (PP not restored).

**Root cause:** `js/engine.js:_healParty` — PP loop checks `move.maxPp !== undefined` (always false) and sets `move.pp` (wrong field). Should be `move.ppUsed = 0`.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #23 - Repel items purchasable but unusable
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/ui.js (`_renderBagTab`), js/engine.js (`useRepel`)

**Description:** The "Repousse" (Repel) item is sold in every Pokémart and is saved/loaded correctly. However there is no usage pathway: `_renderBagTab` only adds click handlers for items of type `'heal'`, `'revive'`, `'status'`, and `'levelup'`. Repel items (type `'repel'`) appear in the bag as unclickable rows. `GameEngine.useRepel(steps)` exists but is never called from any UI handler.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Go to any Pokémart and purchase a Repousse (350 $)
2. Open the menu → Sac
3. The item is listed but has no pointer cursor and cannot be clicked

**Expected:** Clicking the Repel in the bag activates it for 100 steps, preventing wild encounters.
**Actual:** Item appears in bag but is unresponsive.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #24 - Escape Rope (Corde Sortie) has no usage handler
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/ui.js, js/constants.js

**Description:** The "Corde Sortie" (Escape Rope) item is defined in ITEMS with type `'escape'` but no code handles this type in either the overworld bag menu or the battle bag. The item cannot be activated. It is not sold in any shop currently, but the definition exists and could be added.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #25 - Defeated trainer state not persisted between sessions
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/battle.js, js/engine.js, js/save-system.js

**Description:** When a trainer is defeated, `BattleSystem.endBattle` sets `trainerNpc.defeated = true` on the in-memory NPC object. However, the `game.state.defeatedTrainers` Set — which is serialized in the save file — is **never populated**. After a page reload, `WorldData.init()` re-creates all NPC objects with `defeated: false`, resetting all trainer defeats. The saved `defeatedTrainers` Set is also never read to restore the defeated state on NPCs, making it completely unused.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Defeat any route trainer (e.g., "Gamin Thomas" on Route 1)
2. Save and reload the page
3. Walk back to the trainer — they challenge the player again

**Expected:** Previously defeated trainers do not re-battle; they show a post-defeat dialogue.
**Actual:** All trainers reset to undefeated state on reload.

**Root cause:** `battle.js:1339` sets `trainerNpc.defeated = true` but never calls `game.state.defeatedTrainers.add(npc.id)`. `interactWithNPC` in `engine.js` never checks `npc.defeated` or the `defeatedTrainers` Set.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #26 - Re-challenging a defeated trainer starts battle with 0-HP enemy
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/engine.js (`interactWithNPC`), js/world-data.js (all gym leader NPCs)

**Description:** In the same session (before a reload), a defeated trainer can be re-challenged. `interactWithNPC` has no check for `npc.defeated`, so the trainer battle dialogue fires again. `startTrainerBattle` detects that `trainerNpc.party` is already built (from the previous battle) and reuses it without checking HP. The battle starts with the trainer's Pokémon at 0 HP, causing an immediate win condition and a second reward payout.

The fix checks `if (npc.defeated && npc.altDialogue)` in `interactWithNPC`. All 8 gym leaders (`gym1_leader` through `gym8_leader`) now have `altDialogue` and `gym{N}_defeated` dialogue entries set in `world-data.js` and `story-data.js`.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Defeat gym leader Marco in Porto City (gym1_leader)
2. Interact with him again immediately
3. A battle starts — Marco's Pokémon has 0 HP

**Expected:** Defeated trainer shows a post-defeat dialogue ("Bien joué !") and cannot be re-battled.
**Actual (original):** Battle starts with a dead enemy; player wins instantly and may receive rewards again.

**Fix verified (2026-03-28):** gym1_leader.defeated=true after battle, re-interaction shows "Bien joué ! Tu m'as impressionné. Ton Pokémon mérite ce Badge Normalité." dialogue. All 8 gym leaders confirmed to have altDialogue properties in world-data.js.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #27 - Gym badges are never awarded after defeating a gym leader
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Critical
**Files:** js/battle.js, js/ui.js, js/engine.js

**Description:** Defeating a gym leader never awards the corresponding badge. `BattleSystem.endBattle` only sets `trainerNpc.defeated = true` and adds the money reward, but never updates `game.state.badges` or the `badge_N` story flags. Since subsequent gym leaders gate behind `storyReq: 'badge_N'`, they never appear — only the first gym is accessible.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Reach Porto City and defeat gym leader Marco
2. Open menu → Dresseur — Badges shows "0 / 8"
3. Travel to Campoverde — gym 2 leader (Flora) is invisible due to `storyReq: 'badge_0'` never being set

**Expected:** Defeating Marco awards Badge 0, sets `storyFlag.badge_0 = true`, adds `0` to `game.state.badges`, and Champion Flora appears in Campoverde.
**Actual:** No badge awarded, `badge_0` stays `false`, gym 2 leader never spawns, story progression is permanently blocked past gym 1.

**Root cause:** No code in `battle.js`, `engine.js`, or `ui.js` reads `trainerNpc.badge` and applies the badge after a gym leader victory. The `badge` property exists on gym leader NPC definitions in `world-data.js` but is never consumed.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #28 - Using a heal/revive item from the overworld bag crashes with undefined `container`
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/ui.js (`_showItemUseTarget`)

**Description:** Clicking a Potion, Rappel, or other usable item in the overworld Sac menu opens a "Utiliser X sur..." screen but the party list and Back button never render. The function crashes on `container.appendChild(list)` because `container` is never defined — the correct variable is `panel`.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Have at least one Potion (or other heal item) in the bag
2. Open menu → Sac → click the Potion
3. Screen shows "Utiliser Potion sur..." with no Pokémon listed and no Back button

**Expected:** Party list appears so player can choose which Pokémon to heal; Back button returns to the bag.
**Actual:** `ReferenceError: container is not defined` is silently swallowed; the panel shows only the title. The item is NOT consumed, so there is no permanent softlock (Escape closes the menu), but items can never be used from the overworld bag.

**Root cause:** `js/ui.js:740` — `container.appendChild(list)` should be `panel.appendChild(list)`. The variable `panel` is declared at line 685 but line 740 mistakenly uses `container`.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #29 - Escape key cannot close the menu
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/engine.js (`handleInput`), js/ui.js (keydown handler)

**Description:** Pressing Escape when the menu is open does not close it — the menu stays open permanently. The key only toggles the menu open when it is closed; it cannot be used to close it.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. In the overworld, press Escape — menu opens (correct)
2. Press Escape again — menu should close, but stays open

**Expected:** Escape toggles the menu: opens it when closed, closes it when open.
**Actual:** The menu cannot be closed with the keyboard at all.

**Root cause:** Two competing keydown listeners handle Escape:
1. `document.addEventListener` in `ui.js` — correctly checks `UI.menu.open` and calls `closeMenu()` when open
2. `window.addEventListener` in `engine.js handleInput` — **unconditionally** calls `UI.openMenu()` on every Escape key press, regardless of menu state

Because `document` events fire before `window` events, the sequence on every Escape press is:
- UI listener fires → calls `closeMenu()` (menu.open = false) ✓
- Engine listener fires → calls `openMenu()` (menu.open = true) ✗

Net result: menu closes and immediately re-opens on every Escape press.

**Fix needed:** In `js/engine.js handleInput`, change the unconditional `UI.openMenu()` call to only open the menu when it is not already open (i.e., `if (!UI.menu.open) UI.openMenu()`), or remove the call entirely since `ui.js` already handles it.

```js
// Current (broken):
if (key === 'Escape' || key === 'x' || key === 'X') {
    if (typeof UI !== 'undefined' && UI.openMenu) {
        UI.openMenu();  // always fires, re-opens after ui.js closes it
    }
}

// Fix:
if (key === 'Escape' || key === 'x' || key === 'X') {
    if (typeof UI !== 'undefined' && UI.openMenu && !UI.menu.open) {
        UI.openMenu();
    }
}
```

## Bug #30 - Shop buy notification missing accent: "achete" → "acheté"
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Cosmetic
**File:** js/ui.js (`_renderShopBuy`, line 1244)

**Description:** After successfully buying an item in a Pokémart, the notification reads `"Poké Ball achete !"` (or `"Potion achete !"` etc.) — the past participle "acheté" is missing its accent.

**Root cause:** `js/ui.js:1244`:
```js
this.showNotification(itemData.name + ' achete !');
// Should be:

## Bug #32 - Additional missing accents in notification strings
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Cosmetic
**File:** js/ui.js

**Description:** Two player-visible notification strings contain missing French accents, distinct from the UI label issues documented in Bug #19.

**Affected locations:**
- `js/ui.js:277` (`_healAllPokemon`): `'Vos Pokemon sont en pleine forme !'` → should be `'Vos Pokémon sont en pleine forme !'`
  - This notification fires when a nurse NPC heals the party (via the `heal_pokemon` dialogue action).
- `js/ui.js:357` (`_selectStarter`): `data.name + ' a rejoint votre equipe !'` → "equipe" should be "équipe"
  - This notification fires immediately when the player picks their starter Pokémon.

**Steps to reproduce (equipe):**
1. Start a new game
2. Enter the lab and choose a starter
3. Observe the notification toast — it reads "Flamby a rejoint votre equipe !" instead of "équipe"

**Steps to reproduce (Pokemon):**
1. Visit any Pokémon Center with a nurse NPC
2. Talk to the nurse and heal the party
3. The toast notification reads "Vos Pokemon sont en pleine forme !" instead of "Pokémon"

## Bug #31 - Shop sell panel empty message missing accent: "Rien a vendre" → "Rien à vendre"
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Cosmetic
**File:** js/ui.js (`_renderShopSell`, line 1264)

**Description:** When opening the "Vendre" tab in a Pokémart with an empty bag, the message reads `"Rien a vendre."` — the preposition "à" is missing its accent.

**Root cause:** `js/ui.js:1264`:
```js
empty.textContent = 'Rien a vendre.';
// Should be:
empty.textContent = 'Rien à vendre.';
```

## Bug #33 - Overworld tiles bleed through the battle scene (middle canvas gap)
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/battle.js (`render`), css/style.css (`#battle-menu`)

**Description:** During battle, the canvas only draws the sky and ground background in the top 55% of the canvas height (`battleHeight = ch * 0.55` = 352px of 640px). The bottom 45% of the canvas (352px–640px) is never cleared or filled by the battle renderer. The `#battle-menu` HTML overlay (action buttons) only covers `min-height: 140px` from the bottom. This leaves an approximately 148px gap between the battle background and the menu panel where the underlying overworld tile map is visible.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Enter any wild or trainer battle
2. Observe the area between the green battle ground and the action buttons

**Expected:** A solid, uniform area (ideally a dark battle panel or extension of the ground) separates the battle scene from the action buttons.
**Actual:** The overworld tile map shows through in the middle section of the battle screen, creating a jarring visual glitch.

**Root cause:** `js/battle.js` line 1223: `const battleHeight = ch * 0.55;` — only the top 55% of the canvas is rendered with the battle background. The canvas area from `battleHeight` (352px) to the canvas bottom is not cleared, so the previous overworld frame shows through in this gap region.

## Bug #34 - HUD badge dots not updated after earning a badge in-session
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/battle.js (`endBattle`), js/main.js (`_loadGame`), js/ui.js (`updateBadges`)

**Description:** When the player defeats a gym leader and earns a badge, `game.state.badges` is correctly updated and persisted, but the HUD badge dots (`.badge-slot` elements in `#badges-display`) are not refreshed. `UI.updateBadges()` — the function that adds the `earned` class to badge slots — is only called in `_loadGame()`. After winning a gym battle in-session, the HUD still shows all badge slots as unearned until the game is saved and reloaded.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Defeat gym leader Marco in Porto City (gym1_leader)
2. Observe the badge slot HUD in the top-right corner
3. All 8 slots remain grey (unearned) even though badge 0 was awarded

**Expected:** Badge slot 0 lights up immediately after defeating the gym leader.
**Actual:** `game.state.badges` contains `[0]`, but `document.querySelectorAll('.badge-slot')[0]` does not have the `earned` class. HUD shows 0/8 until page reload.

**Root cause:** `battle.js` awards the badge at line 1348 (`game.state.badges.push(badgeIndex)`) but does not call `UI.updateBadges()` afterward. `updateBadges()` should be called in `endBattle` whenever a badge is awarded.

## Bug #35 - Pokédex detail view removes menu tab bar; Retour doesn't restore it
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/ui.js (`_showPokedexDetail`)

**Description:** Clicking any seen or caught Pokémon entry in the Pokédex tab opens a detail view. `_showPokedexDetail` does `panel.innerHTML = ''` which clears the entire panel including the `.menu-tabs` navigation bar. The detail view renders without any tab bar. The "Retour" button in the detail view calls `_renderPokedexTab(panel)` which renders the Pokédex grid directly into the panel — also without a tab bar. The player is stuck in the Pokédex with no ability to navigate to Équipe, Sac, Dresseur, or Sauvegarder without closing and reopening the menu.

**Compare with:** `_showPokemonDetail` (party detail view) — its Retour button correctly calls `this._renderMenu()` which rebuilds the full menu including the tab bar.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Have a seen or caught Pokémon in the Pokédex
2. Open menu → Pokédex tab
3. Click on the Pokémon entry
4. The tab bar (Équipe / Sac / Pokédex / Dresseur / Sauvegarder / Quitter) disappears
5. Click "Retour" — still no tab bar, permanently stuck in Pokédex grid

**Expected:** Clicking Retour from a Pokédex detail returns to the full menu (tabs + Pokédex grid).
**Actual:** Tab bar is gone after entering Pokédex detail; Retour renders the grid without restoring tabs.

**Root cause:** `js/ui.js:1018–1022` — the Retour button calls `_renderPokedexTab(panel)` instead of `_renderMenu()`.

**Fix:** Changed `_renderPokedexTab(panel)` to `this._renderMenu()` in the Retour click handler, matching the pattern used by `_showPokemonDetail` and `_showItemUseTarget`.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #36 - Caught ball type always recorded as 'pokeball' regardless of ball used
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/battle.js (`_processCatchSuccess`)

**Description:** When a Pokémon is caught with any ball (Super Ball, Hyper Ball, Master Ball), the `caughtBall` property on the caught Pokémon is always set to `'pokeball'`. The `_executeCatch(ballId)` function receives the correct `ballId` parameter but calls `_processCatchSuccess()` without passing it. `_processCatchSuccess` has no access to `ballId` and hardcodes `ep.caughtBall = 'pokeball'`.

While `caughtBall` is currently not displayed anywhere in the UI, it is saved/loaded in the save system and could be used in future features (e.g., displaying which ball caught the Pokémon in a detail view or trainer card).

**Root cause:** `js/battle.js:1082,1120` — `this._processCatchSuccess()` is called without passing `ballId`. `_processCatchSuccess` at line 1149 hardcodes `'pokeball'` instead of the actual ball used.

**Fix needed:** Pass `ballId` to `_processCatchSuccess(ballId)` and use it: `ep.caughtBall = ballId;`

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #37 - "Quitter" uses full page reload instead of in-app navigation
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/ui.js (`_renderQuitterTab`), js/main.js

**Description:** When the player confirms "Oui, quitter" in the Quitter menu tab, the game saves and then reloads the entire page via `location.reload()`. This causes a visible browser reload rather than a smooth return to the title screen.

**Root cause:** `ui.js` checks `if (game && typeof game.returnToTitle === 'function') { game.returnToTitle(); } else { location.reload(); }`. The `game.returnToTitle` function is never defined in `main.js`, so the fallback `location.reload()` is always triggered.

The save does occur before the reload (correct behaviour), but the UX is jarring — the browser briefly shows a blank page before the title screen re-renders.

**Fix needed:** Implement `game.returnToTitle()` in `main.js` that resets game state and returns to the title screen without a full page reload (e.g., stop the game loop, hide `#game-container`, show `#title-screen`, reset `game.state`).

## Bug #38 - Aquali back sprite not rendered in battle
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/battle.js, js/sprite-renderer.js

**Description:** When Aquali is the active player Pokémon in battle, its back sprite does not appear on the player-side platform. Only the brown mound platform is visible. Other Pokémon (e.g. Rondelet) correctly show their back sprite. The issue appears to be specific to Aquali (species id 4).

**Root cause:** Likely a missing or incorrectly keyed back-sprite entry for species id 4 in SpriteRenderer, or a rendering condition that skips drawing when the back-sprite canvas/image is undefined for that species.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #39 - Using a Potion on a full-HP Pokémon silently fails with no feedback
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28) — Already handled: notification "a déjà tous ses PV !" at line 814
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/ui.js (`_useItemOnPokemon` or `_showItemUseTarget`)

**Description:** In the overworld bag menu, selecting "Potion" and then clicking a Pokémon at full HP silently does nothing — the item is not consumed, the target selector stays open, and no message or visual feedback is shown. The player has no indication of why the item did not work.

**Root cause:** The usage guard likely returns early without triggering any notification or error dialogue when `currentHp >= maxHp`.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #40 - After losing a trainer battle (all Pokémon KO), player is not warped to last Pokémon Center
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/battle.js (battle result / whiteout handling)

**Description:** When the player's entire team faints during a trainer battle, the game heals the party (correct) and shows "Vous n'avez plus de Pokémon apte au combat !" but does NOT warp the player back to the last visited Pokémon Center. The player remains at the location where the battle took place (e.g. Route 1). In standard Pokémon games this triggers a "whiteout" that transports the player back to the nearest PC.

**Root cause:** The whiteout handler heals the party but is missing the warp-to-last-PC step. No `lastHealMap`/`lastHealX`/`lastHealY` coordinates appear to be tracked or applied.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #42 - Evolved species not registered in Pokédex after evolution
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/pokemon-data.js (`evolvePokemon`), js/battle.js (evolution handling)

**Description:** When a player's Pokémon evolves during battle (e.g. Aquali Lv15 → Aquanox at Lv16), the evolved species is not added to `game.state.pokedexSeen` or `game.state.pokedexCaught`. The pre-evolution entry remains marked as seen/caught, but the new species entry (e.g. Aquanox id:5) does not appear as caught or seen in the Pokédex. In standard Pokémon games, evolution registers the new species as owned/seen automatically.

**Root cause:** `evolvePokemon()` in `pokemon-data.js` changes `pokemon.id` and `pokemon.name` but does not update `game.state.pokedexSeen` or `game.state.pokedexCaught`. The evolution handling in `battle.js` (around line 1039) calls `evolvePokemon()` but also does not add the new ID to the Pokédex sets.

## Bug #43 - Aquali back sprite suspected missing (needs verification)
**Status:** Cannot Reproduce
**Priority:** Low
**File:** js/sprite-renderer.js

**Description:** Bug #38 claimed Aquali's back sprite was not rendered in battle. Further testing confirms the sprite cache entry `4_112_back_false` contains 4709 non-transparent pixels and the back-facing sprite renders correctly. The original observation may have been made during battle initialisation before the sprite was cached, or during an animation state with `playerAnim.alpha = 0`. No persistent rendering failure detected.

## Bug #41 - Stale nurse dialogue (with wrong health status) re-appears after map transition
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/ui.js (dialogue state management), js/engine.js (warp handling)

**Description:** After interacting with the nurse in Borgo (which sets `inputLocked` and opens a dialogue), navigating away via a teleport or warp without properly dismissing the dialogue can cause the nurse's second message ("Vos Pokémon sont en pleine forme ! Bonne continuation !") to surface later on a different map (Route 1). This occurs even when the party Pokémon are not at full HP, so the message content is also inaccurate in that context.

**Root cause:** Dialogue state (`inputLocked`, open dialogue queue) is not cleared/reset when the player warps between maps. If the dialogue callback fires after a warp, it uses the last registered speaker/text regardless of current context.

**Found:** 2026-03-28

## Bug #44 - Attack menu shown for fainted Pokémon instead of forced switch
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/battle.js

**Description:** When the active Pokémon faints during battle (enemy attacks first and KOs it), the game briefly shows the ATTAQUE move selection menu (listing the fainted Pokémon's moves) instead of immediately forcing a switch to the next alive Pokémon. The player can see moves for a 0 HP Pokémon and must manually click RETOUR → POKÉMON to switch. The forced switch (`_handlePlayerFaint`) does eventually work if the player navigates to it, but the initial display is wrong.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Have 2+ Pokémon in party, with the active one at low HP
2. Enter a battle where the enemy outspeeds you
3. Select ATTAQUE and pick a move
4. Enemy attacks first and KOs your Pokémon
5. Instead of showing the switch menu, the attack move list appears

**Root cause:** Likely a race condition between `_processMessageQueue` and `_showActions()` in `_checkFaintsAfterTurn`. The faint check runs after the enemy turn, but the message queue callback may call `_showActions()` before `_handlePlayerFaint()` has had a chance to set up the forced switch UI. The `_checkFaintsAfterTurn` at line 916 may not be reached because the earlier faint check at line 884 already returned — but the message queue from `_doEnemyTurn` may still trigger `_showActions` asynchronously.

## Bug #45 - Shop overlay not dismissed on map transition / teleport
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/ui.js, js/engine.js

**Description:** If the player has the shop open and the game triggers a map transition (warp, teleport, or any state change that moves to a different map), the shop overlay remains visible on the new map. The shop continues to function (buy/sell) even though the player is no longer near the merchant NPC. This can also cause the shop to appear on top of battle UI if a battle starts while the shop is still open.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Open the shop at any merchant
2. Without closing it, trigger a map change (e.g., via save/load, teleport, or code)
3. The shop overlay persists on the new map

**Root cause:** The map transition / warp logic in `engine.js` does not close the shop overlay. There is no `UI.closeShop()` call in the warp handling code. The fix should add `UI.closeShop()` to the warp/map-change handler.

## Bug #46 - Defeated route trainers can be re-battled infinitely
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Critical
**File:** js/engine.js (interactWithNPC), js/world.js (trainer NPC definitions)

**Description:** After defeating a route trainer (e.g., "Gamin Thomas" on Route 1), talking to them again immediately triggers a new battle instead of showing a post-defeat dialogue. The trainer IS correctly added to `game.state.defeatedTrainers` and `npc.defeated` is set to `true`, but the re-battle still happens.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Fight and defeat any route trainer (e.g., Gamin Thomas on Route 1)
2. Talk to the same trainer again
3. A new battle starts instead of post-defeat dialogue

**Root cause:** In `engine.js:interactWithNPC()`, line 440 checks `if (npc.defeated && npc.altDialogue)` to use the alternate dialogue. However, route trainers do NOT have an `altDialogue` field defined — only gym leaders do (Bug #26 fix only added `altDialogue` to gym leaders). When `altDialogue` is undefined, the check falls through and uses the original `trainer_battle` dialogue, re-triggering the battle.

**Fix:** Either:
1. Add a generic post-defeat dialogue for all trainers (e.g., "Tu m'as déjà battu !") and set `altDialogue` on all trainer NPCs, OR
2. Change the check in `interactWithNPC` to also guard against defeated trainers without altDialogue: `if (npc.defeated) { dialogueKey = npc.altDialogue || 'trainer_defeated_generic'; }`

## Bug #47 - Lazy-loaded maps don't restore defeated trainer state on reload
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/world-data.js (`getMap`)

**Description:** `game._loadGame()` restores defeated trainer flags on NPC objects by iterating `WorldData.maps`. However, only 3 maps are eagerly generated at startup (`borgo`, `player_house`, `prof_lab`). All other maps (routes, cities) are lazy-loaded on first visit. If the player saves after defeating a trainer on `route1`, reloads the game, and then visits `route1` — the map is freshly generated by `getMap('route1')` and the NPC objects have `defeated = false`. The restoration code already ran before route1 was generated, so it never patched these NPCs.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Defeat "Gamin Thomas" on Route 1
2. Save the game
3. Reload the page
4. Walk to Route 1
5. "Gamin Thomas" re-challenges the player despite being marked defeated in the save

**Root cause:** `WorldData.getMap()` generates the map when first accessed, but `_loadGame()` already iterated `WorldData.maps` (which didn't include route1 yet) to set `npc.defeated = true`.

**Fix:** Added defeated trainer restoration inside `WorldData.getMap()` immediately after lazy-generating a map — checks `game.state.defeatedTrainers` and sets `npc.defeated = true` on all newly created NPCs whose IDs are in the set.

## Bug #48 - Evolution skipped when leveling up mid-trainer-battle
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/battle.js (`_handleEnemyFaint`)

**Description:** If the player's Pokémon levels up and triggers an evolution while defeating a non-last Pokémon in a trainer battle, the evolution sequence never plays. The `pendingEvolve` state is set, but the code returns early to send out the trainer's next Pokémon, bypassing the evolution handling block entirely.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Have a Pokémon one level below its evolution threshold (e.g. Aquali at level 15, evolves at 16)
2. Fight a trainer with 2+ Pokémon
3. Defeat the trainer's first Pokémon to reach level 16
4. Evolution message never appears; battle continues normally without evolution

**Root cause:** `_handleEnemyFaint` checks `if (nextPkmn && nextPkmn.currentHp > 0)` and returns early without ever reaching the `pendingEvolve` processing block further down.

**Fix:** Extracted the "continue trainer battle or end battle" logic into a `continueAfterExp()` closure. The evolution sequence (if any) now always runs first via `_processMessageQueue`, then calls `continueAfterExp()` afterward — whether mid-trainer-battle or at the final victory.

## Bug #49 - Gym leaders, Elite 4, and Champion unreachable inside solid buildings
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Critical
**File:** js/world-data.js

**Description:** All gym buildings and the Pokémon League buildings use solid BUILDING/GYM_BUILDING tiles for the entire interior. NPCs (gym leaders, Elite 4, Champion) are placed inside these solid tiles. The player can enter through the DOOR tile but cannot walk further inside because surrounding tiles are non-walkable. This makes all gym leaders, Elite 4 members, and the Champion unreachable through normal gameplay.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Enter any city gym through its door
2. Try to walk toward the gym leader
3. Movement is blocked by solid building tiles

**Root cause:** `_fillRect` fills the entire building area with BUILDING/GYM_BUILDING tiles (non-walkable), including the interior space where NPCs stand. The fix needs to carve walkable GYM_FLOOR tiles inside each building from the door to the NPCs.

## Bug #50 - Duplicate event listeners accumulate when returning to title and starting a new game
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**Files:** js/engine.js, js/ui.js

**Description:** When the player returns to the title screen (via `game.returnToTitle()`) and then starts or continues a new game, `GameEngine.init()` and `UI.init()` are called again. Both functions add `window`/`document` event listeners for keyboard input and dialogue interaction without checking if they were already registered. After two or more restarts without a page reload, every keypress fires multiple event handlers, causing inputs to be processed 2–3× per keypress. Movement becomes erratic, dialogue advances multiple steps per click, and menu/escape toggles can fire out of sync.

**Additionally:** `GameEngine.init()` did not reset transient engine state (`warping`, `encounterActive`, `inputLocked`, `repelSteps`, `keysDown`, etc.). Stale flags from a previous game session could persist into the next game.

**Fix:** Added `_eventsBound: false` flag to both `GameEngine` and `UI`. Event listener registration is now guarded by `if (!this._eventsBound)` — only runs once per page load. Added explicit reset of all transient `GameEngine` state at the start of `init()`.

## Bug #51 - No feedback when Pokémon's moveset is full and cannot learn a new move
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/battle.js (`_handleEnemyFaint`)

**Description:** When a Pokémon levels up in battle and would learn a new move but already has 4 moves, `addExp()` emits a `newmove_full` event. This event was never handled in `battle.js` — the new move was silently dropped with no notification. The player had no indication that their Pokémon tried to learn a move.

**Fix:** Added handler for `evt.type === 'newmove_full'` in `_handleEnemyFaint`. Queues message: `"X voudrait apprendre Y, mais a déjà 4 attaques !"`.

## Bug #53 - MART tile interaction does nothing — shop unreachable via tile
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/engine.js

**Description:** Standing in front of the MART tile at Porto (29,12) and pressing Space/Enter does nothing. The shop is only accessible by interacting with the Vendeur NPC at (29,11). Players who approach the MART entrance naturally will get no response and may not realise a merchant NPC is present.

**Root cause:** `_handleInteraction()` only looked for `sign` NPCs at the MART tile position. No sign NPC exists there; the merchant NPC is at a different coordinate. The shop action never fired from the tile.

**Fix:** Added merchant NPC lookup when a MART tile is faced: if the facing tile is TILE.MART and no sign NPC is found there, the code now searches for any `merchant` NPC in the map and calls `interactWithNPC(npc)` on it — triggering the standard shop dialogue and shop UI.

## Bug #54 - Holding arrow key only advances one tile (browser key-repeat ignored)
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28) — Already handled: `_checkMovementKeys()` is called every frame in `GameEngine.update()` when `!this.moving && !this.inputLocked`. It samples `this.keysDown` (maintained by keydown/keyup events), so held keys produce continuous movement without relying on key-repeat events.
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/engine.js

**Description:** Holding an arrow key moves the player exactly one tile then stops. The player must tap the key repeatedly to continue moving. Browser key-repeat events fire while the key is held but are all dropped because the engine gates movement on `!this.moving`.

## Bug #55 - No location name banner after warp transitions
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28) — Already handled: `_executeWarp()` in engine.js calls `UI.showLocationName(newMap.name)` after every map transition. `showLocationName` displays the banner for 3s with CSS fade. Verified in code.
**Priority:** Low

## Bug #56 - Poké Ball throw in trainer battle skips turn AND does not consume the ball
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/battle.js

**Description:** Throwing a Poké Ball at a trainer's Pokémon correctly shows "On ne peut pas capturer le Pokémon d'un dresseur !" but immediately returns to the action menu — the turn is NOT consumed and the Poké Ball quantity remains unchanged. In mainline Pokémon games the throw wastes the player's turn (enemy still attacks) and the ball is consumed.

**Fix:** Moved `game.state.bag[itemId]--` before the trainer check so the ball is always consumed. Changed the trainer-battle branch to call `this._executeTurn({ type: 'item' })` instead of `_processMessageQueue(() => _showActions())` — enemy now attacks after the failed throw.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Enter a trainer battle
2. Open SAC → click Poké Ball
3. Message appears, returns to action menu
4. HP unchanged (enemy did not attack), ball count unchanged

**Priority:** Low

## Bug #58 - Catch celebration confetti particles persist indefinitely on overworld
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Low
**File:** js/battle.js

**Description:** After a successful Pokémon catch, colored confetti particles appear on the ground. When returning to the overworld those particles remain visible on the map and do not fade or despawn — they persist indefinitely across the session.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Catch a Pokémon in a wild battle
2. Return to the overworld
3. Golden/pink confetti particles remain visibly on the ground near the player's position

**Fix:** `endBattle()` now immediately clears `this.state.confetti = []` and calls `clearInterval(this.state.confettiTimer)` so confetti stops as soon as the battle ends. The `confettiTimer` reference is stored on `this.state` (was a local variable before) so `endBattle` can cancel it.

## Bug #59 - Badge count always 0 — two separate badge tracking systems out of sync
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28) — Resolved as part of Bug #27 fix. `BattleSystem.endBattle()` at js/battle.js lines 1478–1485 now sets BOTH `game.state.storyFlags['badge_N'] = true` AND `game.state.badges.push(badgeIndex)` when a gym leader is defeated.

**Description:** The Dresseur (trainer card) tab shows "Badges: 0 / 8" and all 8 badge slots show "?" regardless of how many gyms have been defeated. The HUD badge row also never shows any earned badges. All 8 gym badge story flags (`badge_0` through `badge_7`) are correctly set in `storyFlags`, but the UI reads from a separate `game.state.badges[]` array which is never populated.

## Bug #60 - Save notification hidden behind dark menu overlay backdrop
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Low
**File:** css/style.css

**Description:** The "Partie sauvegardée !" notification fires correctly when clicking "Sauvegarder maintenant" (z-index:80 > menu z-index:60) and appears in the DOM, but it is rendered at `top: 50px` within `#ui-layer`, which visually falls inside the semi-transparent dark menu backdrop. The dark-on-dark placement makes the notification effectively invisible to the player while the menu is open.

**Fix:** Changed `.notification` position from `top: 50px; transform: translateX(-50%)` to `top: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`. Notification now appears centered in the viewport, overlapping the menu panel where it is clearly visible. Animation keyframe updated to match new centered transform.

## Bug #61 - Pokémon nature displayed in English in party detail view
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Low
**File:** js/ui.js (_showPokemonDetail)

**Description:** The party Pokémon detail screen shows the nature in English (e.g. "Naughty") instead of French ("Coquin"). All other UI text in this view is in French.

**Fix:** Added `NATURE_NAMES_FR` mapping at the top of `ui.js` (all 25 natures translated to French). `_showPokemonDetail` now renders `NATURE_NAMES_FR[pokemon.nature] || pokemon.nature` instead of `pokemon.nature` directly.

## Bug #64 - Overworld menu opens during trainer battle intro
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** High
**Files:** js/engine.js, js/ui.js

**Description:** When the player presses Space/Enter to interact with a trainer NPC, the in-game overworld menu (Équipe/Sac/Pokédex tabs) appears on top of the trainer battle screen. The battle starts correctly in the background, but the menu overlay is also visible, blocking the battle UI.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Stand adjacent to a trainer NPC (e.g. trainer_r1_1 on Route 1)
2. Press Space to interact
3. The trainer battle begins AND the menu overlay opens simultaneously

**Root cause (suspected):** The Space keydown event is handled by both `GameEngine.handleInput()` (to start the interaction) and `UI._bindKeys()` (to advance dialogue). When the interaction fires and immediately creates a trainer dialogue, `advanceDialogue()` runs in the same event tick and rapidly processes the `{action:'trainer_battle'}` step. During this rapid transition, the menu state or gameMode may briefly enter an unexpected state that causes the menu overlay to open.

## Bug #67 - Rappel (Revive) not usable from battle bag
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/battle.js (`_showBag`, line ~268)

**Description:** The Rappel (Revive) item cannot be used during battle even when the player has them in their bag. The in-battle SAC screen only shows item types: `'ball'`, `'heal'`, and `'status'`. The Rappel has type `'revive'`, so it is silently excluded. Players cannot revive a fainted Pokémon mid-battle.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Have Rappel ×N in bag
2. Enter any battle and click SAC
3. Rappel does not appear in the battle bag list

**Root cause:** `_showBag()` at line 268 filters: `item.type === 'ball' || item.type === 'heal' || item.type === 'status'`. The `'revive'` type is not included. `ITEMS.revive` = `{name:'Rappel', type:'revive', healPercent:0.5, price:1500}`.

**Fix:** Add `|| item.type === 'revive'` to the filter in `_showBag()`.

## Bug #65 - FUITE button permanently disabled after any trainer battle
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/battle.js (`_showActions`)

**Description:** After fighting a trainer battle (where FUITE is correctly disabled), every subsequent wild battle also has FUITE permanently disabled. The run button appears greyed out and unclickable for the rest of the session. Players have no way to escape from wild Pokémon using the UI button, though calling `BattleSystem.tryRun()` directly confirms the escape logic itself works correctly.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Fight any trainer battle (FUITE correctly greys out)
2. After winning/losing, enter a wild Pokémon battle
3. FUITE button remains disabled (opacity 0.4) despite being a wild encounter

**Root cause:** In `_showActions()` (line ~191), buttons are cloned via `btn.cloneNode(true)`. `cloneNode(true)` preserves all attributes including `disabled=true` from the previous trainer battle. The code then only sets `disabled=true` when `isTrainer=true` — it never explicitly resets `disabled=false` for wild battles. The stale disabled state from the clone persists.

**Fix:** Add an explicit reset in `_showActions()` for non-trainer battles:
```js
if (newBtn.dataset.action === 'run') {
    if (this.state.isTrainer) {
        newBtn.disabled = true;
        newBtn.style.opacity = '0.4';
    } else {
        newBtn.disabled = false;     // ← add this
        newBtn.style.opacity = '1';  // ← add this
    }
}
```

## Bug #66 - Active dialogue persists into next battle (stale dialogue overlay)
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/ui.js, js/battle.js

**Description:** If a dialogue is still open (e.g., a trainer's post-defeat dialogue) when a new battle is started programmatically, the dialogue box remains visible on top of the battle screen. The text from the previous interaction continues to show in the dialogue overlay.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Defeat a trainer and interact with them again — get post-defeat dialogue
2. Without fully dismissing the dialogue, trigger another battle
3. The old dialogue text is visible over the battle UI

**Root cause:** Neither `game.startBattle()` nor `BattleSystem.startWildBattle()` checks if `UI.dialogue.active` is true and clears the dialogue before starting. The dialogue box is only hidden when `_handleDialogueAction('trainer_battle')` is called, not in the general battle-start path.

## Bug #62 - Porto south exit unreachable — warp tiles placed on non-walkable water
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Critical
**File:** js/world-data.js (porto map generation)

**Description:** Porto's south edge contains warp tiles intended to lead to Route 1, but they are placed at y=39 on water tiles (tile type 3, WATER). Water tiles are not in the WALKABLE_TILES set, so the player cannot reach them. The southernmost walkable row in Porto is y=29. Players have no way to exit Porto to the south through normal gameplay.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Start in Porto and try to walk south past y=29
2. Movement is blocked by water tiles
3. The warp to Route 1 at y=39 is completely unreachable on foot

**Root cause:** Porto's map generator places south-exit warp targets at y=39 but fills tiles between y=29 and y=38 with WATER (tile 3) without placing a walkable path or bridge leading to the warp.

**Workaround:** Directly call `GameEngine.warp('route1', x, y)` in the browser console.

## Bug #63 - HP displays as "NaN/50" after leveling up mid-battle
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Critical
**File:** js/battle.js

**Description:** During a trainer battle (Eclipse Grunt on Route 3), after Aquanox leveled up by defeating the Grunt's first Pokémon, the HP display in the player's battle status card showed "NaN/50" for the remainder of the battle. The party dot for Aquanox also turned red (critical HP), as if the HP value was numerically interpreted as NaN < threshold. The HP bar itself appeared visually correct, but the numeric HP text was broken.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Have Aquanox near a level-up threshold (e.g., Nv.16 → 17)
2. Fight the Eclipse Grunt on Route 3
3. Defeat the Grunt's first Pokémon, triggering a level-up
4. The HP display switches to "NaN/50" for the rest of the battle

**Root cause (suspected):** On level-up, `addExp()` recalculates `stats.hp` to a new maximum. If `currentHp` is updated to the new max but the UI reads `pokemon.currentHp` before it is set, or if the stat recalculation assigns `NaN` to `currentHp` during the HP scaling formula (e.g., dividing by zero or using an undefined ratio), the display value becomes NaN. The `_updateUI` function likely renders `pokemon.currentHp` directly without a `Number.isFinite()` guard.

## Bug #68 - Invisible NPCs (storyReq not met) still interactable via keyboard
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/engine.js (`_handleInteraction`)

**Description:** NPCs with an unmet `storyReq` (e.g., `gym1_leader` with `storyReq: 'has_starter'`) are correctly skipped during rendering and movement collision, but the `_handleInteraction` function did not check `storyReq` or `disappearAfter` before calling `interactWithNPC`. A player facing the tile of an invisible NPC and pressing Space would still trigger its dialogue and potentially start a battle.

**Example:** The Porto gym leader (`gym1_leader`) is invisible until `has_starter` flag is set. A player who skipped the starter and reached Porto could stand at (38, 19) facing north, press Space, and trigger the gym leader battle with no Pokémon in their party.

**Root cause:** `_handleInteraction`'s NPC loop at line 418 had no `storyReq` or `disappearAfter` guards, unlike the rendering loop (line 208) and collision loop (line 394-396).

**Fix:** Added `if (npc.storyReq && !state.storyFlags[npc.storyReq]) continue;` and `if (npc.storyFlag && npc.disappearAfter && state.storyFlags[npc.storyFlag]) continue;` to the NPC loop in `_handleInteraction`.

## Bug #69 - returnToTitle causes crash on next Space press / dialogue state not cleared
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** High
**Files:** js/ui.js (`_endDialogue`), js/main.js (`returnToTitle`)

**Description:** Two related issues:

1. `_endDialogue()` at line 235 calls `game.state.gameMode = 'overworld'` with only `if (game)` guard. After `returnToTitle()` sets `game.state = null`, any lingering dialogue callback or action that triggered `_endDialogue` would throw `TypeError: Cannot set properties of null` on `game.state.gameMode`.

2. `returnToTitle()` did not clear `UI.dialogue.active`, `UI.dialogue.callback`, `UI.menu.open`, or `GameEngine.inputLocked`. If the player quit while a dialogue was active, `UI.dialogue.active` would remain `true`. On the title screen, the `advanceDialogue()` could still be triggered by Space, eventually calling `_endDialogue()` which would then crash at `game.state.gameMode`.

**Fix:**
- Changed `if (game) game.state.gameMode = 'overworld'` to `if (game && game.state) game.state.gameMode = 'overworld'` in `_endDialogue` (all 3 occurrences).
- Added cleanup to `returnToTitle()`: clears `UI.dialogue.active`, `UI.dialogue.callback`, `UI.menu.open`, and `GameEngine.inputLocked`.

## Bug #70 - Trainer battle enemy Pokémon never added to Pokédex as "seen"
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/battle.js (`startTrainerBattle`, `_handleEnemyFaint`)

**Description:** When fighting a trainer, none of the trainer's Pokémon are ever registered in `game.state.pokedexSeen`. Only Pokémon that are actually caught (via `_processCatchSuccess`) get added to `pokedexSeen`. Since trainer Pokémon cannot be caught, they will never appear in the Pokédex — even after battling them. The player could defeat all 8 gym leaders without a single gym leader Pokémon appearing in their Pokédex.

**Root cause:**
- `startTrainerBattle` initialises the battle with `enemyPokemon` but never calls `game.state.pokedexSeen.add(enemyPokemon.id)`.
- In `continueAfterExp` (inside `_handleEnemyFaint`), when the trainer sends out their next Pokémon (`this.state.enemyPokemon = nextPkmn`), the new Pokémon's ID is also never added to `pokedexSeen`.

**Fix:** Added `if (game && game.state) game.state.pokedexSeen.add(enemyPokemon.id)` in `startTrainerBattle` after `_initBattle`. Added the equivalent for `nextPkmn` in `continueAfterExp`.

## Bug #71 - End-of-turn status damage skipped when player uses item, switches, or fails to run
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/battle.js (`_executeTurn`)

**Description:** When the player uses an item, switches Pokémon, or fails to run, `_executeTurn` takes an early return path that calls `_doEnemyTurn` then `_checkFaintsAfterTurn` — but skips the `_processStatusEndTurn` calls entirely. As a result, burn damage, poison damage, badly-poisoned damage (toxic), and leech seed damage are NOT applied at the end of those turns. A poisoned Pokémon that uses a Potion takes no damage that turn, making status conditions significantly weaker than intended.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Let a Pokémon get poisoned in battle
2. Use a Potion from the bag on that Pokémon
3. Observe: no "X souffre du poison !" message and no HP drop at end of turn

**Expected:** Status damage applies every turn regardless of what action the player took.
**Actual:** Status damage is silently skipped whenever the player uses an item, switches, or fails to flee.

**Root cause:** `js/battle.js` `_executeTurn` — the item/switch/run_fail branch returns early after `_doEnemyTurn` without ever reaching the `_processStatusEndTurn` calls at the bottom of the function.

**Fix:** Added an explicit player-faint check after `_doEnemyTurn` (to avoid applying status to an already-fainted Pokémon), followed by `_processStatusEndTurn` for both Pokémon, before calling `_checkFaintsAfterTurn`.

## Bug #72 - WorldData.maps not reset between game sessions — stale NPC state bleeds into new/loaded games
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/main.js (`_newGame`, `_loadGame`)

**Description:** `WorldData.maps` is a global object populated lazily during gameplay. When the player returns to the title screen via `returnToTitle()` and then starts a new game or loads a save, `WorldData.maps` still holds all NPC objects from the previous session. Any mutable NPC state set during that session — most notably `npc.defeated = true` on beaten trainers — persists into the new session. A brand-new game would encounter trainers that say "Tu m'as déjà battu !" because they were defeated in the previous play session.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Start a new game, defeat "Gamin Thomas" on Route 1
2. Open menu → Quitter → confirm → return to title
3. Start a new game
4. Walk to Route 1 and interact with "Gamin Thomas"
5. He shows the post-defeat dialogue instead of initiating a battle

**Root cause:** Neither `_newGame()` nor `_loadGame()` in `main.js` cleared or re-initialized `WorldData.maps` before use. The lazy-generated maps were reused as-is, including all NPC state mutations from the previous session.

**Fix:** Added `WorldData.maps = {}; WorldData.init();` at the top of both `_newGame()` and `_loadGame()`. Clearing `maps` forces all maps to be regenerated fresh on first access, with clean NPC state. `WorldData.init()` recreates the 3 eagerly-generated maps (borgo, player_house, prof_lab) immediately.

## Bug #73 - SaveSystem auto-save timer leaks on repeated game starts
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-28)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/save-system.js (`_startAutoSave`)

**Description:** `SaveSystem.init()` is called every time the player starts a new game or loads a save (via `_newGame()` and `_loadGame()` in `main.js`). Each call invokes `_startAutoSave()`, which creates a new `setInterval` timer and stores it in `this._timer`. However, the old timer is never cleared before creating the new one. After N session restarts (without a page reload), there are N concurrent save timers running, all calling `this.save()` every 10 seconds.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Start a new game
2. Open menu → Quitter → confirm → return to title
3. Start another new game
4. Repeat 5+ times — there are now 6 setInterval timers running

**Expected:** Only one auto-save timer runs at a time.
**Actual:** Each session restart adds a new timer; old timers are never cancelled.

**Root cause:** `_startAutoSave()` at `js/save-system.js:16` does not check if `this._timer` is already set before creating a new interval.

**Fix:** Added `if (this._timer) { clearInterval(this._timer); this._timer = null; }` at the start of `_startAutoSave()` to ensure only one timer runs at a time.

## Bug #74 - Bag item use screen does not refresh HP display after applying a potion
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/ui.js (`_showItemUseTarget`, `_useItemOnPokemon`)

**Description:** When a player opens the bag in the overworld, selects a healing item (Potion, Super Potion), and uses it on an injured Pokémon via the "Utiliser X sur..." screen, the underlying `pokemon.currentHp` value is updated correctly but the HP text displayed in the item-target list (`PV: X/Y`) is not refreshed. The stale value from when the screen was first rendered remains visible. The player must close and reopen the menu to see the updated HP.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Injure a Pokémon (e.g., Aquali at 20/53 HP)
2. Open menu → Sac → click Potion
3. The "Utiliser Potion sur..." list shows Aquali at "PV: 20/53"
4. Click Aquali to apply the Potion
5. The item-target list still shows "PV: 20/53" — HP was healed to 40/53 but the display was not updated

**Expected:** After using a healing item, the Pokémon's HP display in the target list updates to reflect the new HP value.
**Actual:** Stale HP displayed. `game.state.party[0].currentHp` = 40, but the rendered text still shows 20/53 until the menu is reopened.

**Root cause:** `_useItemOnPokemon` in `ui.js` heals the Pokémon and calls `this.showNotification()` + closes the target sub-view, but does not re-render the "use item on..." list. The `.details` div in the rendered party list is created once and never updated in-place.

**Fix:** After a successful item use, immediately call `_showItemUseTarget(itemId)` to re-render the panel with updated HP values. An 800ms timeout then navigates back to the main menu.

## Bug #75 - Pokémon caught at or above their evolution level do not auto-evolve
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/battle.js (`_handleExpGain`), js/pokemon-data.js (`createPokemon`)

**Description:** When a Pokémon is obtained (caught in the wild or added to the party via `createPokemon`) at a level equal to or above its `evolveLevel`, no evolution is triggered. The evolution system only fires during a battle level-up event (`pendingEvolve` in `_handleExpGain`). If a Pokémon was never leveled up through battle while at its evolveLevel, it will remain unevolved indefinitely — even at levels 50+ — until the next time it levels up in battle.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Wild encounter: catch Insectyl (evolveLevel: 10) at exactly level 10
2. Inspect it in the party — it is still Insectyl, not Chrysalyd
3. Battle with Insectyl as lead; defeat a weak enemy to gain exp
4. If Insectyl does not gain enough exp to level up, no evolution fires
5. Only when Insectyl gains a level-up (reaching level 11+) in battle does the evolution trigger

**Expected:** A Pokémon obtained at or above its evolution level should either evolve immediately (at time of capture) or prompt evolution at next level-up.
**Actual:** No evolution occurs until the next battle level-up. At level 10 (= evolveLevel) nothing triggers; only at level 11+ does `pendingEvolve` fire.

**Root cause:** `createPokemon` does not check `evolveLevel` after creating the Pokémon. `_executeCatch` → `_processCatchSuccess` also does not check or apply evolution. Evolution is exclusively handled via `pendingEvolve` events emitted by `_handleExpGain` when `newLevel >= data.evolveLevel`.

**Fix:** Added evolution check in `_processCatchSuccess` (battle.js): after registering the caught Pokémon in the Pokédex, calls `checkEvolution(ep)`. If an evolution target exists, `evolvePokemon` is applied immediately, the new species is registered in the Pokédex, and evolution messages are queued before `endBattle('catch')`.

## Bug #76 - Item free-use exploit after last item consumed
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** Major
**File:** js/ui.js (`_useItemOnPokemon`)

**Description:** When using the last item of a stack from the overworld bag (e.g., the only Potion), the item quantity drops to 0 and the item is deleted from `game.state.bag`. Immediately afterward, `_showItemUseTarget(itemId)` was called to refresh the HP display panel. This re-rendered the item-use target screen using static data from `ITEMS` (not the bag), showing the panel as if the item still existed. During the 800ms window before `_renderMenu()` navigated away, the player could click a second Pokémon and apply the item effect again for free — without any bag entry being decremented.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Have exactly 1 Potion in the bag
2. Open menu → Sac → click Potion → click an injured Pokémon
3. The item target screen refreshes; within 800ms, click a second injured Pokémon
4. The second Pokémon is healed without consuming any item

**Root cause:** `_useItemOnPokemon` unconditionally called `this._showItemUseTarget(itemId)` after decrement, even when the item had just been deleted from the bag.

**Fix:** Added a check: only call `_showItemUseTarget(itemId)` if `game.state.bag[itemId] > 0` after the decrement. Otherwise, the 800ms `setTimeout` to `_renderMenu` fires alone.

## Bug #77 - Antidote cannot cure badly_poisoned (Toxic) status
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** Major
**Files:** js/ui.js (`_useItemOnPokemon`), js/battle.js (`selectItem`)

**Description:** The Antidote item has `cures: 'poison'`. The game tracks two distinct poison statuses: `'poison'` (regular) and `'badly_poisoned'` (Toxic, from the `toxic` move). The status cure check used strict equality (`pokemon.status === item.cures`), so an Antidote used on a Pokémon with `badly_poisoned` status would show "Cela n'aura aucun effet." and fail to cure it. This applies in both the overworld bag and the in-battle bag.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Let a Pokémon get badly poisoned by an enemy using the Toxic move
2. In overworld: open menu → Sac → use Antidote on the poisoned Pokémon → message "Cela n'aura aucun effet."
3. In battle: open SAC → use Antidote → "Ça n'a aucun effet !"

**Expected:** Antidote cures both `poison` and `badly_poisoned` statuses.
**Actual:** Antidote only cures `poison`; `badly_poisoned` is not cured.

**Root cause:** Strict equality check: `pokemon.status !== itemData.cures`. Never matches when status is `'badly_poisoned'` and `cures` is `'poison'`.

**Fix:** Changed both locations to also allow curing when `item.cures === 'poison'` and status is `'badly_poisoned'`:
```js
const statusCured = pokemon.status && (
    pokemon.status === itemData.cures ||
    (itemData.cures === 'poison' && pokemon.status === 'badly_poisoned')
);
```

## Bug #76 - Poké Ball consumed when thrown at trainer Pokémon
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/battle.js (~line 794)

**Description:** When the player throws a Poké Ball (or any ball) during a trainer battle, the ball is removed from the bag even though it cannot be used. The game shows the correct "cannot catch trainer's Pokémon" message, but the ball count still decreases.

**Root cause:** `game.state.bag[itemId]--` is executed before the `isTrainer` check on line 796. The ball is consumed before the guard can prevent it.

**Fix:** Moved the `isTrainer` guard before `game.state.bag[itemId]--` in `selectItem`. If trainer battle, queue message and execute turn (enemy attacks) without decrementing the ball count.

**Steps to reproduce:** Enter a trainer battle, open SAC, use any Poké Ball.

## Bug #77 - Forced switch screen shows stale move list after player Pokémon faints
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** Medium
**File:** js/battle.js

**Description:** When a player's Pokémon faints during a trainer battle, the forced switch screen should show party member buttons. Instead, the battle-moves panel continues showing the previous turn's move list (with a RETOUR button) until `_showParty()` is called via the `_processMessageQueue` setTimeout chain.

**Root cause:** `_processMessageQueue` uses setTimeout (1500ms delay) before calling the callback that sets `turnPhase = 'forced_switch'` and calls `_showParty()`. During the 1500ms window, the UI still shows the old move selection.

**Fix:** Added `this._hideMenus()` at the start of `_handlePlayerFaint()` so menus are immediately cleared when a faint is detected, before the 1500ms message queue runs.

## Bug #78 - Sleep move applied via effect doesn't set _sleepTurns — target wakes up immediately
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/battle.js (`_executeMove`)

**Description:** Moves that apply the sleep status via `effect: { type: 'status', status: 'sleep' }` (e.g., Poudre Dodo, Hypnose) never set `_sleepTurns` on the target. In `_processStatusBeforeTurn`, the sleep case does `pokemon._sleepTurns = (pokemon._sleepTurns || 0) - 1`, which evaluates to `(0) - 1 = -1 ≤ 0`, causing the Pokémon to wake up immediately on the very next turn. Sleep moves are completely ineffective — the target always wakes up on its first turn.

**Root cause:** In `_executeMove`, when `effect.type === 'status'`, the code sets `defender.status = effect.status` but does not set `defender._sleepTurns`. The only place `_sleepTurns` was previously set was in the Rest move handler (hardcoded to 3). All other sleep applications left `_sleepTurns` as `undefined`.

**Fix:** Added `if (effect.status === 'sleep') { defender._sleepTurns = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 2; }` immediately after `defender.status = effect.status` in the status effect handler. Sleep now lasts 2–4 turns as intended.

## Bug #79 - Level-up items (Bonbon Rare) fully restore HP instead of scaling proportionally
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/ui.js (`_useItemOnPokemon`)

**Description:** Using a level-up item on a damaged Pokémon in the overworld bag menu unconditionally set `pokemon.currentHp = pokemon.stats.hp` after the level-up — fully restoring HP to the new maximum. In standard Pokémon games, leveling up only heals the HP that was gained from the stat increase, not the full bar. A Pokémon at 5/50 HP that levels up to a 55 HP max should end up at 10/55, not 55/55.

**Root cause:** `js/ui.js` `_useItemOnPokemon` levelup case: `pokemon.currentHp = pokemon.stats.hp;` — sets to max unconditionally, unlike the `addExp()` function in `pokemon-data.js` which correctly computes `hpGain = newMax - oldMax` and adds only that amount.

**Fix:** Changed to save the old max HP before `recalcStats`, compute the HP gain, then apply it proportionally: `pokemon.currentHp = Math.min(pokemon.currentHp + hpGain, pokemon.stats.hp);`

**File:** js/constants.js (MOVES_DB)

**Description:** Two moves defined in Pokémon learnsets do not exist in MOVES_DB: `smokescreen` (learned by Flamby/Flamberg at level 9) and `slash` (learned by Flamberg at level 25). When `_showMoves()` renders move buttons, it skips any move with `!MOVES_DB[move.id]`, causing these moves to be silently absent from the battle UI — players will see only 3 moves instead of 4 when the affected Pokémon knows one of these.

**Root cause:** MOVES_DB is missing entries for `smokescreen` and `slash`. Both move IDs appear in learnset definitions but have no corresponding entry in the moves database.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Have Flamby in party above level 9
2. Start a battle and click ATTAQUE
3. Only 3 move buttons appear — smokescreen is invisible and cannot be used

## Bug #81 - Stale move buttons from previous battle visible during new battle intro
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** Low
**File:** js/battle.js (`startWildBattle`, `startTrainerBattle`)

**Description:** When a new battle starts, the battle UI is displayed immediately, but `_showActions()` is not called until after the first message finishes processing (~1500ms delay). During this window, move buttons from the previous battle remain visible in the DOM. If the active Pokémon changed between battles (e.g. a different Pokémon leads), the stale buttons show a different Pokémon's moves.

**Root cause:** `startWildBattle` and `startTrainerBattle` call `_processMessageQueue(() => this._showActions())` which only renders fresh action buttons after the intro message delay. No cleanup of the previous battle's `battle-moves` div is performed before the queue starts.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Battle with Pokémon A leading; reach the move selection screen
2. End that battle and immediately start a new battle with Pokémon B leading
3. During the "X sauvage apparaît !" message, the battle UI shows Pokémon A's moves

## Bug #82 - `escape_rope` key not defined in ITEMS constant
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/constants.js (ITEMS)

**Description:** The ITEMS constant key for the escape rope was `'escaperope'` (no underscore). This was inconsistent with the conventional underscore-separated key style and would cause any bag entry stored as `'escape_rope'` (with underscore) to be invisible in the bag UI. The Corde Sortie was also not available for purchase in any shop.

**Fix:** Renamed `escaperope` → `escape_rope` in ITEMS (constants.js). Added `'escape_rope'` to the shop items list in `_openShopUI` (ui.js) so it is now purchasable. All bag entries, shop purchases, and UI renders now use the consistent `'escape_rope'` key.

## Bug #83 - Bag items (antidote, repel, escape_rope) silently dropped after save/load
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** Critical
**File:** js/constants.js, js/ui.js

**Description:** Bag items `antidote` and `repel` (which are now confirmed to persist correctly through save/load) and `escape_rope` (which was stored with key `'escaperope'` in ITEMS but `'escape_rope'` elsewhere) could appear invisible in the bag UI. The root cause for `escape_rope` was the key mismatch — `ITEMS['escape_rope']` returned `undefined`, causing `_renderBagTab` to skip the item via the `if (!itemData) return` guard.

**Fix:** Renamed `escaperope` → `escape_rope` in ITEMS (Bug #82 fix). Save/load of `antidote` and `repel` is verified correct — both keys match ITEMS and the bag serialization preserves all keys. `escape_rope` key is now consistent throughout.

## Bug #84 - First item purchase from shop gives 4× quantity for 1× price
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/ui.js (`_renderShopBuy`)

**Description:** Clicking a shop item button the very first time after opening the shop purchases the item once but grants 4× the quantity. For example, buying 1 Poké Ball gives 4 Poké Balls for 200 PO. Subsequent purchases of the same item in the same shop session work correctly (1 for 1). Closing and reopening the shop resets the bug, causing the first purchase to grant 4× again.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Open the Rivalta merchant shop
2. Click "Poké Ball ×1" once
3. Check bag — 4 Poké Balls added, only 200 PO deducted

**Root cause:** Click event listeners on buy buttons accumulate if `_renderShopBuy` is somehow called multiple times before the first interaction. The suspected mechanism involves the dialogue/interaction system triggering `_openShopUI` more than once in rapid succession, causing multiple listener registrations on the same DOM node.

**Fix:** Added `{ once: true }` to all buy button `addEventListener` calls in `_renderShopBuy`. Each listener auto-removes after firing once, preventing any accumulated listeners from firing more than once per button click, regardless of how many times the button was registered.

## Bug #85 - Game loop dies silently on any unhandled JS exception
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** Critical
**File:** js/main.js (`loop`)

**Description:** The `game.loop(timestamp)` function calls `update(dt)` and `render()` inside the rAF callback with no try/catch wrapper. Any unhandled JavaScript exception thrown during `update()` or `render()` permanently terminates the animation loop — the game freezes completely (no movement, no animations, no input response) with no error message shown to the player. The only recovery is a page reload.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Trigger any unhandled JS exception during gameplay (e.g., access a property on `undefined` in a move handler, or during an encounter transition with malformed Pokémon data)
2. The game silently freezes — no toast, no dialog, no in-game error visible
3. Player must reload the page and loses unsaved progress

**Root cause:** `game.loop()` has no try/catch around `update()` or `render()`. Any uncaught exception escapes to the rAF scheduler which does not reschedule the next frame after a throw, permanently stopping the loop.

**Fix:** Wrapped `this.update(dt)` and `this.render(timestamp)` in a try/catch block inside `loop()`. The `requestAnimationFrame` call is now always reached, keeping the loop alive even after exceptions. Errors are logged to the console via `console.error`.

## Bug #86 - Player stuck unable to move after returning from a battle that triggered mid-step
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** High
**File:** js/main.js (`endBattle`)

**Description:** If a wild encounter fires while the player is mid-movement (i.e., `this.moving === true` when `startEncounter()` is called), `encounterActive = true` blocks movement processing in `update()`. The move-completion callback that resets `moving = false` never runs during the encounter transition or battle. When the battle ends and `gameMode` returns to `'overworld'`, `this.moving` is still `true`, blocking `_checkMovementKeys()`. The player appears stuck on the map and cannot move.

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Walk through tall grass on Route 3 repeatedly
2. If a random encounter fires at the exact moment between `_tryMove()` setting `moving=true` and the movement step completing, the player gets stuck
3. Battle plays out normally
4. After returning to the overworld the player cannot move at all — all directional input is ignored

**Root cause:** `GameEngine.update()` guards movement with the encounter-active check. When `startEncounter()` fires mid-move, `moving` stays `true`. The encounter transition completes and calls `game.startBattle()` changing `gameMode` to `'battle'`. When `gameMode` returns to `'overworld'`, the `moving` flag is never cleared because `_updateMovement()` was never given a chance to finish the step and fire its completion callback.

**Fix:** Added `GameEngine.moving = false; GameEngine.encounterActive = false;` at the start of `endBattle()` in `main.js`. This ensures any stale mid-step movement state is cleared when returning from battle.

## Bug #85 - Battle bag item use leaves zero-quantity entries in bag on save
**Status:** Fixed (2026-03-29)
**Priority:** Minor
**File:** js/battle.js (`selectItem`, `_showReviveTarget`)

**Description:** When using heal, status cure, revive, or Poké Ball items in battle via `selectItem` and `_showReviveTarget`, the bag quantity is decremented but zero-quantity entries are never deleted from `game.state.bag`. This is inconsistent with the overworld `_useItemOnPokemon` handler which correctly calls `delete game.state.bag[itemId]` when quantity reaches 0.

**Root cause:** `selectItem` (heal, status, ball cases) and `_showReviveTarget` (revive click handler) all decrement `game.state.bag[itemId]--` without a subsequent cleanup.

**Fix:** Added `if (game.state.bag[itemId] <= 0) delete game.state.bag[itemId];` after each bag decrement in `selectItem` and the revive handler in `_showReviveTarget`.
